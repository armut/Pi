Estimating the Value of PI Using Monte Carlo Method Using MPI Library
=====================================================================

This program is my first application in MPI programming.

The aim of the program is to estimate the value of pi parallelly exploiting
all the power the proccessor is capable of.

There are shell scripts for performance measurements which simply run the program
many times by changing one variable with respect to another in the `analysis` folder.

There is a report explaining the code and presenting the analysis results in the `docs`
folder.
